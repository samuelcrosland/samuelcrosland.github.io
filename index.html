      <p>
      I’ve worked as a Product Manager for the last 9 years, and I have a background in design.</p>
      <p>I specialise in leading digital product teams to build software that creates and sustains online communities. I've done this succesfully at companies like Twitter, Depop, and Peanut. If you’d like to talk to me about building digital products that bring people together, or that help humans to find purpose <a href="mailto:samuelcrosland@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.
      </p>
      If you want to know more about me, I write about what I’m up to in my <a href=" https://www.notion.so/samuelcrosland/Samuel-Crosland-s-Weeknotes-5f821be8fb604b7bbb5d787fe7dc3988" target="_blank">weeknotes</a>. A more professional view, with a view of the projects I've been involved with is accessible <a href="https://read.cv/samuelcrosland" target="_blank">here</a>.

       I wrote the code for this page myself as I'm curious about building internet products, I used a combination of Superhi's <a href="https://www.superhi.com/learn-to-code-now-book" target="_blank">book</a> and github pages. This site won't track any of your data, but the sites I link to probably will. Have a safe onward journey.
